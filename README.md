# Dynamic Quote Generator

A simple web application that dynamically displays quotes from different categories and allows users to add their own quotes and categories in real-time.

## Features

- Display a random quote with its category.
- Add new quotes dynamically via an interactive form.
- Quotes and categories are managed entirely on the client side.
- Uses advanced DOM manipulation techniques in vanilla JavaScript without any frameworks.

## How It Works

- On page load, the app displays a random quote.
- The **Show New Quote** button displays another random quote from the current list.
- Users can add new quotes and categories using the input form dynamically generated by JavaScript.
- Newly added quotes immediately become available for random display.

## Files

- `index.html` — Basic HTML structure with placeholders and buttons.
- `script.js` — Contains all JavaScript logic for quote display, addition, and form creation.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click **Show New Quote** to see a random quote.
3. Use the input fields below to add a new quote and its category.
4. Click **Add Quote** to save it and see it displayed immediately.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)

## Future Improvements

- Persist quotes using `localStorage` or backend database.
- Add filtering by category.
- Improve UI/UX with CSS styling.
- Add animations for quote transitions.
